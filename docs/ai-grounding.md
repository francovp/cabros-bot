# AI Grounding & Prompt Management

[← Back to README](../README.md)

## Alert Enrichment with Gemini Grounding (001)

The webhook alert system can optionally enrich alerts with verified sources and market context using Google Gemini API with GoogleSearch grounding.

### MCP Flow

When `ENABLE_GEMINI_GROUNDING=true`:

1. Alert text received via webhook
2. Gemini API queries with GoogleSearch grounding enabled
3. Returns summary and extracted sources (URLs with titles)
4. Enriched alert formatted and sent to all enabled channels (Telegram, WhatsApp)

### Enrichment Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines market sentiment (BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL) with confidence score
- **Key Insights**: Extracts bullet points of critical information
- **Technical Levels**: Identifies support and resistance levels mentioned in context
- **Risk Parameters**: Optionally reports invalidation level, target level, setup type, and estimated risk/reward ratio
- **Secondary Fallback Trade Plan**: When TradingView MCP supplies a price but its ATR-derived risk block is rejected (ATR `0`, non-finite, or a level failing the side/positivity check), the enrichment fills those three fields from the timeframe-based heuristic in `src/services/tradingview/fallbackTradePlan.js` and tags them `levelsSource: "fallback-trade-plan"`. A valid ATR-derived block always wins, and an invalid ATR is still never turned into a synthetic ATR stop. Heuristic levels are provenance-tagged precisely so downstream consumers can weigh them below real ATR levels.
- **Verified Sources**: Extracts URLs and titles from GoogleSearch results
- **Language Support**: Respects original language of alert text
- **Graceful Fallback**: If enrichment fails, original alert is sent without delays
- **Reusable Results**: Single grounding call shared across all notification channels

### Configuration

- `ENABLE_GEMINI_GROUNDING` - Enable/disable enrichment (default: `false`)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google API key with Generative AI enabled
- `ENABLE_TOKEN_COST_BUDGET` - Enable/disable global LLM daily token spend tracking and budget enforcement (default: `false`)
- `TOKEN_COST_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` - Daily LLM spend ceiling in USD before calls fail open (default: `5.00`)
- `TOKEN_COST_WARN_THRESHOLD_PCT` - Percentage of daily budget that triggers an admin Telegram alert (default: `80`)

### How Langfuse Prompt Management Works

When `ENABLE_LANGFUSE_PROMPTS=true`, runtime prompts are fetched from Langfuse through the centralized prompt service in `src/services/prompts/`.

The local fallback prompts now live as editable text templates under `src/services/prompts/defaults/`, which makes them much easier to review, diff, and version independently from the prompt registry code.

Managed prompts currently include:

- search-query derivation
- grounded summary generation
- webhook alert enrichment
- news analysis
- secondary confidence enrichment
- Gemini market price fetch query

Behavior notes:

- **Fail-open by design**: if Langfuse is disabled, misconfigured, unavailable, or missing a prompt, the app automatically falls back to the local prompt text files in `src/services/prompts/defaults/`.
- **Label-based rollout**: use `LANGFUSE_PROMPT_LABEL` (for example `latest`, `staging`, or `production`) to switch prompt versions without code changes.
- **SDK caching**: prompt fetches use the Langfuse SDK cache and can be tuned with `LANGFUSE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`.
- **Current architecture contract**: prompts are compiled into the existing `systemPrompt` / `userPrompt` flow, so provider routing for Gemini, Azure, and OpenRouter remains unchanged.
- **Alert enrichment schema**: Langfuse `alert-enrichment` versions should mirror the local fallback's optional `invalidation_level`, `target_level`, `setup_type`, and `risk_reward_ratio` fields. The prompt service inspects resolved remote prompts against `REQUIRED_ALERT_ENRICHMENT_RISK_FIELDS`, records `schemaDriftDetected: true` and missing risk fields if any are omitted, and warns once per version without failing open delivery.
