**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Created**: 2025-10-26

**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [PASS] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [PASS] Focused on user value and business needs
- [PASS] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [PASS] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [PASS] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [PASS] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [PASS] Success criteria are measurable
- [PASS] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [PASS] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [PASS] Edge cases are identified
- [PASS] Scope is clearly bounded
- [PASS] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [PASS] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [PASS] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [PASS] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [PASS] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation notes


- The spec was updated to resolve the three clarification questions with stakeholder choices. Implementation-level details (provider/package and env var names) have been moved to the Appendix so the main spec remains technology-agnostic.
