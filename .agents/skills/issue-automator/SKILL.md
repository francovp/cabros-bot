description: >-
  Automates the end-to-end processing of open GitHub issues for the current repository. Use when the user requests automating issue resolution, synchronizing Linear tracker states, verifying Render preview deployments, merging ready PRs without human review, or resolving review threads. Do not use for repositories other than the current repository or for general Git operations unrelated to issue lifecycle automation.

## Hard Rules

1. If the user explicitly provides a GitHub issue number (e.g. `#42`, `issue 42`, `GH-42`), use that specific issue. Otherwise, work on the oldest open GitHub issue.
2. Process only one issue by default.
3. Process a further issue only after a skip outcome (`LOCAL_DEADLOCK` or `IN_REVIEW` with no agent writes). Non-skip outcomes stop the run — do not touch further issues.
4. Never process more than 2 GitHub issues that require agent writes in one run. Issues already `IN_REVIEW` with no agent writes (skips) are zero-work — they do not consume this budget and only advance the cursor to the next oldest issue.
5. Never inspect deeply, plan, or create TODOs for issues beyond the current cursor in the skip loop — only the issue currently being processed is touched at a time.
6. Never build an unbounded work queue.
7. Never continue to another issue after `DONE`, `SHIPPED`, `SYNCED`, `GLOBAL_BLOCKED`, `NEEDS_USER`, or `AMBIGUOUS`. For `IN_REVIEW`, stop only if the agent actively produced a PR or made changes; if the issue was already in review with no code/PR/Linear writes needed, skip it — keep fetching the next oldest open issue until a non-skip outcome or no issues remain (see Step 6 skip loop).
8. Never create duplicate Linear issues or duplicate PRs.
9. Treat `agent-working` as an ownership claim, not as a decorative label.
10. Use the GitHub issue number as the dedupe key for Linear.
11. Prefer live repo state over assumptions.
12. Prefer `gh` and `linear` CLIs over MCP tools when available.
13. Distinguish local blockers from global blockers.
14. Stop cleanly on global blockers, ambiguity, or missing ownership.
15. **GitHub user switching**: Before any `gh` CLI command, always switch to the `francovp` user with `gh auth switch --user francovp`. After all `gh` commands are complete, restore the original user with `gh auth switch --user <original_user>`. The helper script `scripts/gh-auth-utils.sh` provides `save_gh_user`, `switch_to_francovp`, and `restore_gh_user` functions for this pattern. All script-based `gh` calls (in `get-oldest-issue.sh`, `verify-preview.sh`) already source this helper — just call them as-is. For inline `gh` commands in the workflow below, execute the switch pattern manually or use the helper.
16. Always use the `create-pr` skill to create or update PRs. Do not hand-roll PR creation with raw `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit` calls from this skill. The PR body must come from `context/<git-branch-name>.md` and follow the repository PR summary format enforced by `create-pr`.
17. When creating or updating a Linear issue, write a readable ticket body with `Summary`, `Context`, `Acceptance Criteria`, and `References` sections so the tracker stays self-contained.

## Notification Webhook

The skill sends notifications to a Telegram bot webhook for alert-worthy events. The webhook endpoint expects a JSON payload with `x-api-key` auth header.

**Configuration** — set these environment variables before running the skill:
- `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` — defaults to `https://cabros-crypto-bot-telegram.onrender.com/api/webhook/message`
- `NOTIFY_API_KEY` — the `x-api-key` header value (required)
- `NOTIFY_CHANNELS` — comma-separated, defaults to `telegram,whatsapp`
- `NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` — defaults to `-1001234567890`
- `NOTIFY_WHATSAPP_CHAT_ID` — defaults to `120363422033474991@g.us`

**Notification helper** — use this curl template whenever a notification is required:

```bash
curl --location "${NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL:-https://cabros-crypto-bot-telegram.onrender.com/api/webhook/message}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header "x-api-key: ${NOTIFY_API_KEY}" \
  --data-raw '{
    "message": "'"${NOTIFY_MESSAGE}"'",
    "channels": ["telegram", "whatsapp"],
    "telegramChatId": "'"${NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID:--1001234567890}"'",
    "whatsappChatId": "'"${NOTIFY_WHATSAPP_CHAT_ID:-120363422033474991@g.us}"'"
  }'
```

**Events that trigger a notification:**
1. **Global deadlock** — when `GLOBAL_BLOCKED` outcome is set, alerting humans that tooling/auth/infra prevents safe work.
2. **PR in review** — when a PR is intentionally handed off for human review in Step 7, notifying that human review is needed.

## Procedural Workflow

Follow these steps in strict chronological order to automate issue resolution:

### Step 1: Pre-flight & Selection
1. **Switch gh to francovp user** — save the current user and switch to francovp for all `gh` commands in this session:
   ```bash
   source scripts/gh-auth-utils.sh && save_gh_user && switch_to_francovp
   ```
2. Determine the target issue:
   - **If the user specifies an issue number** (via `#42`, `issue 42`, `GH-42`, or similar): fetch that specific issue with `gh issue view <NUMBER> --json number,title,createdAt,labels,url`.
   - **If no issue number is given**: run `scripts/get-oldest-issue.sh` to fetch the oldest open GitHub issue (the script handles switching to francovp internally).
3. Select it as the primary issue.
4. Do not fetch, inspect, select, plan, or create TODOs for any second issue at this stage.
5. If no open GitHub issues exist (and none was specified), stop execution immediately.
6. For the primary issue:
   - Check any linked or related Linear issue.
   - Check all open, closed, merged, and draft PRs that reference the issue.
   - Check unresolved review threads and CI status if a PR exists.

### Step 2: Ownership & Takeover Check
1. Inspect the issue and PR for an active `agent-working` label.
2. Do not duplicate work if the label was recently updated by another active agent.
3. If ownership is unclear or takeover is unsafe, stop and end the issue with outcome `NEEDS_USER`.
4. If the ownership claim is stale, note the takeover in the issue/PR thread and reclaim it by updating the label.

### Step 3: Align with Linear Tracker
1. Check if a linked Linear issue exists. Refer to `references/outcomes-and-deadlocks.md` for specific tracker sync rules.
2. If no Linear issue exists:
   - Create a new Linear backlog issue.
   - Use the GitHub issue number as the external dedupe key.
   - Give the issue a concise, action-oriented title.
   - Format the description with clear sections:
     - `Summary` — one sentence on the problem or request
     - `Context` — why the work exists and any important background
     - `Acceptance Criteria` — what must be true to consider the issue done
     - `References` — GitHub issue URL, related PRs, or docs
   - Link the Linear issue back to the GitHub issue.
   - Add `agent-working` label to the GitHub issue.
3. If a Linear issue exists:
   - Evaluate status: if `Blocked`, end the issue with `LOCAL_DEADLOCK`. If `Needs info`, end with `NEEDS_USER`. If `Canceled`/`Duplicate`, sync GitHub and end with `SYNCED`.
   - If multiple Linear issues remain ambiguous, end with `AMBIGUOUS`.

### Step 4: Action Plan & Implementation
1. Check out a clean branch locally.
2. Implement the changes matching the issue acceptance criteria.
3. Run local tests to verify changes:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```
4. If an open PR exists, reuse it. Do not create a parallel PR.
5. Update or create `context/<git-branch-name>.md` with the branch summary using the repository's PR description format (`Summary`, `Key Changes`, `Technical Implementation`, `Testing`, `References`). This file is the required input for the `create-pr` skill.
6. Use the `create-pr` skill to push changes and create/update the PR. Do not call raw `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit` directly from this workflow.
7. Add `agent-working` to the PR once created.

### Step 5: Verification & Deploy Check
1. Ensure the PR meets all criteria in `references/readiness-and-verification.md`.
2. Retrieve the PR number and run `scripts/verify-preview.sh <PR_NUMBER>` to verify the Render preview deployment is live and healthy.
3. Address any unresolved discussions, especially review comments from `@francovp` or `@codex`.
4. Observe the quiet window and retry policies specified in `references/readiness-and-verification.md`.
5. If the PR is ready to land and the agent is confident no human review is needed, merge it, remove `agent-working`, sync GitHub/Linear to the shipped state, and end with outcome `SHIPPED`. If human review is still needed, continue to Step 7 instead. If the verification fails repeatedly with issue-specific errors, end with outcome `LOCAL_DEADLOCK`.
### Step 6: Skip Loop — Advance Past Blocked or Already-Handled Issues

Both `LOCAL_DEADLOCK` and `IN_REVIEW` with no agent writes are **skip outcomes** — the agent did not produce a PR or make changes for this issue. Keep advancing until a non-skip outcome or no issues remain.

1. If `LOCAL_DEADLOCK`: Write a concise blocker summary on the issue or PR. Sync GitHub, Linear, and PR states.
2. If `IN_REVIEW` with no agent writes: Do not modify the issue, PR, or Linear state — everything is already correct.
3. Re-run `scripts/get-oldest-issue.sh` to fetch the next oldest open issue.
4. If no more open issues exist, stop execution.
5. Process this next issue from Steps 1–5 (treat it as the new primary).
6. If it again ends with a skip outcome (`IN_REVIEW` no-writes or `LOCAL_DEADLOCK`), repeat from step 1.
7. If it ends with any other outcome, proceed to Step 7 with that outcome.

Skip outcomes do not count toward the max-2 issues-that-require-writes limit (Hard Rule #4).

If the primary issue ends with any other outcome (including `IN_REVIEW` with agent writes), stop execution immediately.

### Step 7: Human Review Handoff & Sync
1. Use this path only when human review is needed and the PR should not be merged directly.
2. Remove `agent-working` from the GitHub issue and PR.
3. Add the `In review` label to the GitHub issue and PR.
4. Move the Linear issue to the `In review` column.
5. Record the final outcome as `IN_REVIEW` according to `references/outcomes-and-deadlocks.md`.
6. Send an `In review` notification to alert humans that a PR needs review:
   ```bash
   PR_URL="$(gh pr view --json url --jq .url 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A")"
   ISSUE_NUM="$(gh issue view --json number --jq .number 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A")"
   NOTIFY_MESSAGE="[IN_REVIEW] PR ready for review — Issue #${ISSUE_NUM}. Review at: ${PR_URL}" \
     curl --location "${NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL:-https://cabros-crypto-bot-telegram.onrender.com/api/webhook/message}" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header "x-api-key: ${NOTIFY_API_KEY}" \
     --data-raw '{
       "message": "'"${NOTIFY_MESSAGE}"'",
       "channels": ["telegram", "whatsapp"],
       "telegramChatId": "'"${NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID:--1001234567890}"'",
       "whatsappChatId": "'"${NOTIFY_WHATSAPP_CHAT_ID:-120363422033474991@g.us}"'"
     }'
   ```
7. **Restore original GitHub user** after all `gh` commands are done:
   ```bash
   restore_gh_user
   ```

## Outcome Summary Contract

Always include a final summary of execution containing:
1. Primary issue processed and its outcome.
2. Outcome of the first non-skip issue, if any (issues with skip outcomes `LOCAL_DEADLOCK` or `IN_REVIEW` no-writes are counted as skipped and listed).
3. Tools utilized (`gh`, `linear`, MCP, or scripts).
4. Details of any global blockers.
5. Performed verification steps (CI, reviews, Render preview ping, and E2E).

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

Refer to this section when encountering execution issues:
- **CLI Authentication Failures**: If `gh` or `linear` CLI calls fail due to auth:
  - First ensure the current user is `francovp` — run `gh auth switch --user francovp` and retry.
  - Verify the `francovp` account has valid credentials with `gh auth status`.
  - If the user switch itself fails, check if `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var is overriding the keyring-based auth.
  - As last resort, check if `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `LINEAR_API_KEY` env vars are loaded. If CLI is unavailable, fallback to MCP commands. If both fail:
  - Send a global-deadlock notification:
    ```bash
    NOTIFY_MESSAGE="[GLOBAL_BLOCKED] Issue automator halted: CLI + MCP auth both failed for $repo/$issue. Human intervention required." \
      curl --location "${NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL:-https://cabros-crypto-bot-telegram.onrender.com/api/webhook/message}" \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header "x-api-key: ${NOTIFY_API_KEY}" \
      --data-raw '{
        "message": "'"${NOTIFY_MESSAGE}"'",
        "channels": ["telegram", "whatsapp"],
        "telegramChatId": "'"${NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID:--1001234567890}"'",
        "whatsappChatId": "'"${NOTIFY_WHATSAPP_CHAT_ID:-120363422033474991@g.us}"'"
      }'
    ```
  - Then end with outcome `GLOBAL_BLOCKED`.
- **Merge Conflicts**: If branch checkout or pushes fail due to conflicts, pull from `master`, resolve conflicts locally, and re-run tests. If resolving conflicts introduces ambiguity, end with `AMBIGUOUS`.
- **Render Preview deployment timeout**: If `scripts/verify-preview.sh` fails after 3 attempts, inspect the Render logs via the Render dashboard. If it is an infrastructure timeout, wait and retry. If it is an application error/crash, treat it as a `LOCAL_DEADLOCK`.
- **Takeover Conflict**: Do not force-remove the `agent-working` label of an active run. Wait or exit with `NEEDS_USER` to allow coordination.
